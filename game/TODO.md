# target indicator
- something which show the direction of the closest target
- Possible solution:
  - measure the angle between the line of sight and each target
  - keep target with the smallest angle
  - convert this quaternion difference into an angle for screen
  - display an arrow for that
- Another solution:
  - project target position on camera near plane
  - get 2d angle from projected position and camera
  - make the target locator turn to this angle
  - THREE.Plane of camera near Plane (http://threejs.org/docs/index.html?q=plane#Reference/Math/Plane)
  - then plane.projectPoint(targetPosition)
  - then Math.atan2(projectedPoint)
